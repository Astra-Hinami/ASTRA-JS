// * Once you deckare a variable you can change its value by assigning different value to it.
let myNum = 1884;
console.log(myNum);
myNum = 8225;
console.log(myNum);

// ! Undefined vs. Undeclared variables.
// undefined : declared but not assigned any value
let aVariable;
console.log(aVariable);

// undeclared : not even declared
// console.log(anotherVariable); this is gonna give an error so better to comment it.

//? Constants : A constant holds the value that doesn't change.
//! to declare a constant you need to initilize it with a value.

const myYearOfBirth = 2003;
console.log(myYearOfBirth);
myYearOfBirth = 2004;
// console.log(myYearOfBirth);  it'll give an error
