In JavaScript, an object is an unorderd collection of key-value pairs. Each pair is colled a property.

following syntax creates an empty object using the literal notation:
let empty = { }

! to create an object with properties, you use the key:value within curly braces. 
For example, following creates an object 'person'

let person = {
    firstName : 'Astra',
    lastName : 'Yumi',

};

Accessing properties of an object:

To access a property of an object you can use one of two notations :
1. The dot notation.
2. The array-like notation.

A. The dot notation:
    syntax : objectName.propertyName
    example: person.firstName
